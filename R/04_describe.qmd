## Describe Data

## Normalization plot before removing NAs

```{r}
# Test normalization with density plot --> medians are equal now
#This plot should be in the describe
df_norm_long |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=intensity, colour=sample)) +
  geom_density() +
  theme_classic()

```

## Density Plot

```{r}
# Check density -> Not ideal, many NA's distort distribution. Feature-wise would be ideal, b ut couldn't figure out how to operate NaIsMindet row-wise

df_nona_long |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=intensity, colour=sample)) +
  geom_density() +
  theme_classic()
```
