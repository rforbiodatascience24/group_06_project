## Load data

## Tidy data:)

### Format for smooth data anlysis

From the very small bit of visualisation I wanted to do, I could see that the replicates should actually be in 1 column (points to Magda). The reason being, that when ggplot calls for data input, it will recognize the variable as the column. *I cannot plot the measured intensities, because they have seperate x values*.

## Data analysis

Showcase that the data is gausian/normal distributed? - prove nice data

Proteome coverage of the analyzed populations. A bar plot of the population counting the average protein group number.

Column diagrams or densitograms for the expression of the cell
