Read the following resources to become smarter on how to create presentations. Remember to have exactly 10 slides. https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/

https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/

## Introduction to the data

Introduction - Here we should introduce the dataset(s) we are working with

## Data tidying and data format

Methods This is a part of description of methods

## What issues did we encounter while tidying the code

Methods Here we write some of our thoughts. Fx long / wide discussion we had. Or our troubles with computing p-value for all. Explain our choices. How did we solve these issues

## Augmenting the data

Methods Explain how/why we did log transformation, normalization, how we dealt with N/As

## PCA

```{r}
print(biplot)
```

## Volcano Plot

The issue here is that I (Magda) can only suceed in inserting the images to the presentation if I use the 'insert picture' button in visual mode. This however creates a new folder named "images" inside the doc folder. I don't think this is desirable since Leon specifically asked us to have nothing but the presentation in the doc folder. I have spent 2 hours trying to resolve the issue of relative paths, using the here call and talking to chat gpt about it. I think our plan B must be to insert the images in this way via the images folder, because I really dont know how to call them from the result folder.
